0.8.7.5 changes
=============
- openssl-1.0.1k or older versions patched for CVE-2014-8275 broke compatibility with Bitcoin and Litecoin.
  This update patches Litecoin to maintain compatibility with CVE-2014-8275 patched openssl.
- If you are running v0.8.7.4 as distributed by litecoin.org you do not need to upgrade.
  The binaries distributed on litecoin.org contain their own copy of openssl so they are unaffected by this issue.

0.8.7.4 changes
=============
- Enforce v2 blocks at height 710000 on mainnet, 400000 on testnet
- Add `-maxorphantx=<n>` and `-maxorphanblocks=<n>` options for control over the maximum orphan transactions and blocks
- Stricter memory limits on CNode
- Upgrade OpenSSL to 1.0.1i (see https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt - just to be sure, no critical issues

0.8.7.2 changes
=============
- Mac and Windows Official Gitian Builds: upgrade to openssl-1.0.1h for CVE-2014-0224
                   Linux Gitian build uses Lucid 0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.18

0.8.7.1 changes
=============
- Mac and Windows Official Gitian Builds: upgrade to openssl-1.0.1g for CVE-2014-0160
                   Linux was not vulnerable with Lucid openssl-0.9.8k
                   Older versions were only vulnerable with rarely used RPC SSL
- If you build from source, be sure that your openssl is patched for CVE-2014-0160.
- Upgrade openssl, qt, miniupnpc, zlib, libpng, qrencode
- Many bug fixes from Bitcoin 0.8.7rc stable branch
    including transaction malleability mitigation backports from 0.9
- Add testnet checkpoints
- Add new testnet seed

0.8.6.2 changes
=============

- Windows only: Fixes issue where network connectivity can fail.

- Cleanup of SSE2 scrypt detection.

- Minor fixes:
  - s/Bitcoin/Litecoin/ in the Coin Control example
  - Fix custom build on MacOS X 10.9
  - Fix QT5 custom build
  - Update Debian build instructions
  - Update Homebrew build 

0.8.6.1 changes
=============

- Coin Control - experts only GUI selection of inputs before you send a transaction

- Disable Wallet - reduces memory requirements, helpful for miner or relay nodes

- 20x reduction in default mintxfee.

- Up to 50% faster PoW validation, faster sync and reindexing.

- Peers older than protocol version 70002 are disconnected.  0.8.3.7 is the oldest compatible client.

- Internal miner added back to Litecoin.  setgenerate now works, although it is generally a bad idea as it is significantly slower than external CPU miners.

- New RPC commands: getbestblockhash and verifychain

- Improve fairness of the high priority transaction space per block

- OSX block chain database corruption fixes
  - Update leveldb to 1.13
  - Use fcntl with `F_FULLSYNC` instead of fsync on OSX
  - Use native Darwin memory barriers
  - Replace use of mmap in leveldb for improved reliability (only on OSX)

- Fix nodes forwarding transactions with empty vins and getting banned

- Network code performance and robustness improvements

- Additional debug.log logging for diagnosis of network problems, log timestamps by default

- Fix rare GUI crash on send

0.8.5.1 changes
===============

Workaround negative version numbers serialization bug.

Fix out-of-bounds check (Litecoin currently does not use this codepath, but we apply this
patch just to match Bitcoin 0.8.5.)

0.8.4.1 changes
===============

CVE-2013-5700 Bloom: filter crash issue - Litecoin 0.8.3.7 disabled bloom by default so was 
unaffected by this issue, but we include their patches anyway just in case folks want to 
enable bloomfilter=1.

CVE-2013-4165: RPC password timing guess vulnerability

CVE-2013-4627: Better fix for the fill-memory-with-orphaned-tx attack

Fix multi-block reorg transaction resurrection.

Fix non-standard disconnected transactions causing mempool orphans.  This bug could cause 
nodes running with the -debug flag to crash, although it was lot less likely on Litecoin 
as we disabled IsDust() in 0.8.3.x.

Mac OSX: use 'FD_FULLSYNC' with LevelDB, which will (hopefully!) prevent the database 
corruption issues have experienced on OSX.

Add height parameter to getnetworkhashps.

Fix Norwegian and Swedish translations.

Minor efficiency improvement in block peer request handling.


0.8.3.7 changes
===============

Fix CVE-2013-4627 denial of service, a memory exhaustion attack that could crash low-memory nodes.

Fix a regression that caused excessive writing of the peers.dat file.

Add option for bloom filtering.

Fix Hebrew translation.
=======
Bitcoin Core version 0.10.4 is now available from:

  <https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.10.4/>

This is a new minor version release, bringing bug fixes, the BIP65
(CLTV) consensus change, and relay policy preparation for BIP113. It is
recommended to upgrade to this version as soon as possible.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>

Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).

Downgrade warning
------------------

Because release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and
parallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not
backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:

* Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are
received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or
other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work
anymore as a result of this.

* The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is
stored on disk, which earlier versions won't support.

If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data
directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from
bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely
synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not
supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.

This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility. There are no
known problems when downgrading from 0.11.x to 0.10.x.

Notable changes since 0.10.3
============================

BIP65 soft fork to enforce OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode
--------------------------------------------------------

This release includes several changes related to the [BIP65][] soft fork
which redefines the existing OP_NOP2 opcode as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY
(CLTV) so that a transaction output can be made unspendable until a
specified point in the future.

1. This release will only relay and mine transactions spending a CLTV
   output if they comply with the BIP65 rules as provided in code.

2. This release will produce version 4 blocks by default. Please see the
   *notice to miners* below.

3. Once 951 out of a sequence of 1,001 blocks on the local node's best block
   chain contain version 4 (or higher) blocks, this release will no
   longer accept new version 3 blocks and it will only accept version 4
   blocks if they comply with the BIP65 rules for CLTV.

For more information about the soft-forking change, please see
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6351>

Graphs showing the progress towards block version 4 adoption may be
found at the URLs below:

- Block versions over the last 50,000 blocks as progress towards BIP65
  consensus enforcement: <http://bitcoin.sipa.be/ver-50k.png>

- Block versions over the last 2,000 blocks showing the days to the
  earliest possible BIP65 consensus-enforced block: <http://bitcoin.sipa.be/ver-2k.png>

**Notice to miners:** Bitcoin Core’s block templates are now for
version 4 blocks only, and any mining software relying on its
getblocktemplate must be updated in parallel to use libblkmaker either
version FIXME or any version from FIXME onward.

- If you are solo mining, this will affect you the moment you upgrade
  Bitcoin Core, which must be done prior to BIP65 achieving its 951/1001
  status.

- If you are mining with the stratum mining protocol: this does not
  affect you.

- If you are mining with the getblocktemplate protocol to a pool: this
  will affect you at the pool operator’s discretion, which must be no
  later than BIP65 achieving its 951/1001 status.

Windows bug fix for corrupted UTXO database on unclean shutdowns
----------------------------------------------------------------

Several Windows users reported that they often need to reindex the
entire blockchain after an unclean shutdown of Bitcoin Core on Windows
(or an unclean shutdown of Windows itself). Although unclean shutdowns
remain unsafe, this release no longer relies on memory-mapped files for
the UTXO database, which significantly reduced the frequency of unclean
shutdowns leading to required reindexes during testing.

For more information, see: <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6917>

Other fixes for database corruption on Windows are expected in the
next major release.
